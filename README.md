# Regularized inversion of aerosol hygroscopic growth factor probability density function (GF-PDF)

This program, published with [Zhang et al. (2022)(https://amt.copernicus.org/preprints/amt-2021-334/)] Derivation of aerosol GF-PDF using regularized inversion methods including LSQ, Tikhonov, and Twomey's algorithm. And here we applied the algorithm to the measurements of humidity-controlled fast integrated mobility spectrometer measurements (HFIMS).
