# Regularized inversion of aerosol hygroscopic growth factor probability density function (GF-PDF)

Derivation of aerosol GFPDF using regularized inversion methods including LSQ, Tikhonov, and Twomey's algorithm. And here we applied the algorithm to the measurements of humidity-controlled fast integrated mobility spectrometer measurements (HFIMS).
