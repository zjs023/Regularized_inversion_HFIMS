This program, published with [Zhang et al. (2022)](https://amt.copernicus.org/preprints/amt-2021-334/), is developed to invert aerosol GF-PDF using regularized inversion methods including LSQ, Tikhonov, and Twomey's algorithm, from the humidity-controlled fast integrated mobility spectrometer measurements (HFIMS) measurements.
