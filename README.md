# Matlab tool for Regularized inversion of aerosol hygroscopic growth factor probability density function (GF-PDF)

This program, published with [Zhang et al. (2022)](https://amt.copernicus.org/preprints/amt-2021-334/), is developed to invert aerosol GF-PDF using regularized inversion methods including Tikhonov, and Twomey's method, from the humidity-controlled fast integrated mobility spectrometer measurements (HFIMS) measurements. For more details, please refer to the paper.
